ODIs and T20Is, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs. He took over the ODI
captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the team to i
ts first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. In June 2013,
when India defeated England in the final of the Champions Trophy in England,
Dhoni became the first captain to win all three ICC limited-overs trophies
(World Cup, Champions Trophy and the World Twenty20)
. After taking up the Test captaincy in 2008,
he led the team to series wins in New Zealand and the West Indies,
and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. In 2009, 
Dhoni also led the Indian team to number one position for the first
time in the ICC Test rankings.
